# oh-hi-markdown

This is a fork of [rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) and is being refactored with some more modern tooling and uses Tailwind instead of `styled-components`. This is a work in progress.

### What's with the name?

This library is named after the (in)famous line from [The Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room)
